This is a copy of the source-code produced during my Master's Degree whose results will be presented in the Symposium in Information and Human Language Technology (STIL 2021). It contains the software produced for the three research stages described in my master's thesis: corpus building, ontological adjustment, and the implementation of verBERT, a software that trains, evaluates, and tests BERT models for the classification of case law documents (Contained in the verb_src directory). 

This copy also contains auxiliary scripts, in the util directory, and a software example for performing a verBERT experiment, in the exps directory, which complements the verBERT source-code.

This copy does not contain the original data used or its by-products since we are not authorized to share them yet.
